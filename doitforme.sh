# This script only works on Linux Systems (or Windows with a functioning bash) and does not actually conform with any kind of Docker standard
# I'm just lazy so I use this.
# What this does:
# Gets the Spigot Code and builds it Locally
# Gets the latest version of dynmap
# Builds the Spigot Image locally and doesn't push it to a registry (you'd have to do that manually, or if demand exists, I'll add that)
# Removes the stuff that was used to build spigot
